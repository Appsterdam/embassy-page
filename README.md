# Appsterdam Embassy Page

This repo contains the template for the Appsterdam Embassy Pages which can be used by the different Appsterdam Embassies around the world.

## Usage

Fork the repository to your local Embassy GitHub organization and use the correct naming convention.


### Settings

Open the `_config.yml` file in the root of the project and update the fields to reflect your embassy.

### Publishing a page

If you run Appsterdam Greece and have an organization page named AppsterdamGreece you should name the forked repository _AppsterdamGreece.github.io_.

Doing so will ensure that anything on the _master_ branch will be published on http://AppsterdamGreece.github.io.

### Obtaining an _yourembassy.appsterdam.rs_ URl

Open an [issue](http://github.com/Appsterdam/Open/issues) on the main [Appsterdam Open GitHub project](http://github.com/Appsterdam/Open) requesting a url.

Make sure to include the following info:

* Your embassy name
* The preffered subdomain (e.g. greece.appsterdam.rs, milaan.appsterdam.rs)
* The GitHub pages URL (e.g. AppsterdamMilaan.github.io)

Assign the issue to [@g7morris](https://github.com/g7morris).
